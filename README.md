# Notebooks

This is a collection of notebooks written using Colab.

The code is generally simple, and relies on vanilla Python/pandas and numpy.
Where external libraries are used, the pip install details are included at the head of the notebook; this should mean all notebooks will run irrespective of your present config in Colab.
